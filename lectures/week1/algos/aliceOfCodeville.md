Once upon a time, in the magical land of Codeville, there lived a young and enthusiastic programmer named Alice. Alice loved solving puzzles and creating beautiful algorithms. She was determined to learn the art of writing pseudocode, a universal language that could be translated into any programming language.

One day, while strolling through the enchanted forest, Alice stumbled upon a mysterious scroll. The scroll had a peculiar inscription that read, "To unlock the hidden treasure, solve the puzzles of pseudocode." Intrigued by the challenge, Alice unrolled the scroll and started reading.

The scroll presented Alice with a series of riddles and problems. Each challenge required her to write pseudocode to solve it. Excited by the opportunity to practice her skills, Alice took out her trusty notebook and began her adventure.

The first riddle on the scroll was about a magic key that opened a door. Alice had to write a pseudocode algorithm to find the correct key.

```javascript
// Welcome to the time loop.  Until you find the key to open the door here you shall remain. I leave you with this knowledge that should you try the wrong key the door will tell you, should you find the right key the time loop will be broken and allow you to return to your journey

// Step 1 we will need a loop the loop will end when the right key is found
// Print error wrong key if key is wrong

// Enter loop
// Check key
// if good end loop if not keep going after printing bad key

arrayOfKeys = [] // an array that contains all the keys to try
var door = false // a way to check the key if it is true the door will open

for(var k = 0; k < arrayOfKeys.length; k++ ) { // start of loop..... (where to start where to end how to move)
    if(arrayOfKeys[k] == true) { // checking key if is true (door will open) then follow instructions
        console.log("Correct Key")
        return arrayOfKeys[k]
    } else {
        console.log("wrong Key")
    }
}

```

Alice moved on to the next challenge

```javascript
// I present to you this container of numbers.  I wish for you to add all the numbers that are even together and enter the final answer into the keypad

// Enter pseudocode here:

// array of the numbers
// sum
// way to find the even numbers to add to the sum
// way to return final answer
array = [2,4,6,5,7,8,9,10,4,24]
sum = 0

for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if(array[i] % 2 = 0) {  // if the value of i divided by 2 has 0 remainders then it is even
        sum = sum + array[i]
    }
    console.log(sum)
    return sum
}

```

As Alice progressed through the scroll, she encountered more complex challenges like sorting algorithms, searching for elements, and traversing graphs. With each puzzle, she honed her pseudocode skills, reinforcing her understanding of JavaScript syntax and logical thinking.

After many hours of intense concentration and problem-solving, Alice finally reached the last page of the scroll. To her surprise, the scroll disappeared, leaving behind a shining chest filled with gold and precious gems. She had unlocked the hidden treasure by mastering the art of pseudocode!

With the newfound wealth and the knowledge she gained, Alice returned to Codeville, sharing her story and the importance of pseudocode with her fellow programmers. From that day forward, Alice's tale became a legend, inspiring aspiring programmers to embrace pseudocode as their guide on their coding journeys.

And so, dear reader, remember Alice's story and the power of pseudocode. With its magic, you too can navigate the vast world of programming, bringing your ideas to life and unlocking hidden treasures along the way.
